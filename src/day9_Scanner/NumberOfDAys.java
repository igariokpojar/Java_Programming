/*
.Create a class named NumberOfDays, an integer variable named month is given, Use switch statement to write a program that can find the number of days in the given number of month.

            EX:
                month = 5

            output:
                31 days

            (Assume that February has 28 days)

        Hints:
            Months that has 31 days: 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12
            Months that has 30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
