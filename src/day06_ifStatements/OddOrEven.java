/*
1. Create a class named OddOrEven, and write a program that can identify if the given number is odd or even
			Ex:
				number = 20

			output:
				20 is an even number: true
				20 is an odd number: false

        Hint: even numbers are the numbers that are evenly divisible by 2 (remainder is zero)

        even: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ...

        odd: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ...
