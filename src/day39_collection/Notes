Java Programming Day39

Topics: Collections
			- List
			- Set
			- Queue

package name: day39_collections


Elements: 	5, 0, 10, 8, 25, 5, 0

List = [5, 0, 10, 8, 25, 5, 0]


Data Structures:
	Array
	Collection
	Map


Collection (I): size is dynamic, supports non-primitives ONLY

		1. List (I): Has Index Number, Allows Duplicate, Maintain insertion order

				1.1 ArrayList: Array based class
							   Accessing/searching the elements are faster

				1.2 LinkedList: Node based class (doubly linked list)
								Insertion & deletion of elements are faster

				1.3 Vector: Same as ArrayList but synchronized
							Is Synchronized ==> Thread-safety

				1.4 Stack: Same as ArrayList but synchronized
							Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) ===> pop()


		2. Set (I): Does not have index number
		            Does not allowed duplicates
		           2.1 HashSet (C): Order is random, accepts null
		           2.2.1 LinkedHashSet (C): Keeps the inserted order, accepts null
		           2.3 TreeSet (C):  keeps the sorted order, does not accept null



		3. Queue (I)



       Synchronized: multiple threads are being executed one thread at a time

			advantage: thread-safety
			disadvantage: slower


       Process: execution instance of program application

       Thread: A sequence of execution within a process


      Creating custom Thread in java:
		    1. by inheriting Thread Class
		    2. by inheriting Runnable Interface

      Multi-threading:
	          Multiple thread objects are executed at the same time



      Multi-tasking:
		             two or more process are running
