 1. Write a program that can reverse the second word of the sentence
             Ex:
                 sentence = "I Love Java";

             output:
                 I evoL Java


 2.  Write a program that can count the even and odd number from an array of integers

 			Note: MUST use for each loop

 3. Write a program that can print out the common elements from two integer array
           Ex:
               arr1: {1,2,3,4,5}
               arr2: {4,5,6,7,8}

           output:
               4 5


           MUST use for each loops


 4. write a program that can count how many palindromes in an array of string
         Ex:
             {"anna", "level", "Java"};

             output:
                 2

 5. Write a program that can display the unique elements of an array

 			MUST use for each loops


 			1. write a program that can multiply each odd number of an integer array by 2
                            ex:
                                array = [1,2,3,4,5];

                            output:
                                array =[2,2,6,4,10]

            2. write a program that can merge two arrays of integers
                    Ex:
                        arr1 = {1,2,3,4}
                        arr2 = {5,6}

                    output
                        arr3 = {1,2,3,4,5,6}


            3. Write a program that can display the unique elements of an array of inetgers
                    Ex:
                        arr = {1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 5}

                    output:
                        3
                        4
