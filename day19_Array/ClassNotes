Java Programming Day19

Topics: Arrays Intro

package name: day19_array


Data Structure: to use the data efficeintly. allows us to store the data in an organized manner

			1. Array
			2. Collection
			3. Map


regular variable:

		DataType  variableName;
		int        age;
		char       gender;
		String     name;
		....

Array:
		DataType[]  variableName;



Arrays Utility class:  Arrays

		presented in "java.util"


		import java.util.Arrays;



Task:
	1. Write a program that can find the maximum number from an array

	2. Write a program that can find the minimum number from an array

	3. Create a char array and store all the alphabet letters in ascending order

	4. Create a char array and store all the alphabet letters in descending order

	5. AverageNumber:
	            1. Ask the user how many numbers they want to enter
	            2. get all the inputs from the user and store them into an array
	            3. Iterate the array & return the average number


    6. Items
			1. Create an array named items with the length of 5
			2. Create an array named prices with the length of 5
			3. Ask user to enter item name and price 5 times and store them into the items and prices arrays
			4. calculate the total price of the arrays
			5. display each item name and price in separate lines

						ItemName -- Price






1. Create a class named Pizza:
            Attributes:
                1. size
                2. numberOfCheeseTopping
                3. numberOfPepperoniTopping

            Actions:
                calcCost(): returns the total cost of the pizza
                toString():returns a String containing the pizza size, quantity of each topping, and the pizza cost as calculated by calcCost()

        Pizza cost is determined by:
                        S: $10 + $2 per topping
                        M: $12 + $2 per topping
                        L: $14 + $2 per topping

2. Create a custom class named BankAccount:
            Attributes:
                1. accountHolder
                2. accountNumber
                3. balance

            Actions:
                1. setInfo(): sets the accountHolder and accountNumber attributes

                2. toString(): displays the full account info

                3. checkBalance():displays the available balance

                4. deposit(amount): increases the balance by the specified amount

                5. withdraw(amount): decreases the balance by the specified amount

                1. create an array named classmates, and store 10 of your classmates' full names
                            print the initials of each classmates in separate lines


                2. create string array, and store the names of your  class mates (10)
                            reverse each students names and print them in separate lines
                            	ex:
                            		arr = {java, python, c#}

                        		output:
                        			avaJ
                        			nohtyp
                        			#c

                3. Given the following arrays:
                        String[] items  = {"Shoes", "Jacket",  "Gloves", "AirPods", "iPad", "iPhone 12 case" };
                        double[] prices = {99.99,      150.0,  9.99,     250.0 ,    439.50,  39.99};
                        int[] itemIDs =   {12345 ,     12346,  12347,    12348,     12349,    12350};


                        1. find out the first index number of "Gloves"

                        2. find out if "iPad" is contained in the item list

                        3. Print the report of each shopping item
                            name - price - #ID


                4. given the following arrays:
                		     	String [] names = {"Anna", "Nancy", "Sarah"};
                		        int [] scores = {90, 75, 80};
                		        char [] grades = new char[names.length];

                         1. write a program that can store the grades of the students in the array named grades
                         2. print the grade report of each students in separate lines
                         		Ex:
                         			Anna's score is 90, and grade is A


                6.  Write a program that can reverse an array of integers and returns it as new array
                        ex:
                            array = {1,2,3,4,5};

                        output:
                            reversedArray = {5,4,3,2,1};


                7. write a program that can move all the zeros to the end of the array
                        Ex:
                            array = {10, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0};

                            output:
                                 {10, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0}


                8. Write a program that can print out the common elements from two integer array
                          Ex:
                              arr1: {1,2,3,4,5}
                              arr2: {4,5,6,7,8}

                          output:
                              4 5
