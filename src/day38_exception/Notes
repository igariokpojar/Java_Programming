Exceptions: unwanted/unexpected events

		Unchecked exceptions: occurs during the runtime

						All the RuntimeExceptions are unchecked exception

						unknown

		Checked exceptions: occurs during the compile time. must be handled right away

						All the non-RuntimeExceptions are checked exception

						known


Error vs Exceptions: Both are throwable, both can crash our program

		Exceptions: can occur during the compile time and runtime
					Occurs due to the issues within the program itself
					Recoverable, can be handled


		Error: Occurs during the runtime
			   Occurs due to the lack/limit of the system resources
			   Irrecoverable, not recommended to handle


Exception handling:

		1. try & catch blocks: used for handling any checked & unchecked exception

					try{
						exception codes
					}catch(ExceptionClass e){
						e.printStackTrace();  // gives us full details of exception
					}


				multiple catch blocks: parent exception type can never be placed before child exception type

				finally block: always get executed regardless of the exception is handled or not handled

								System.exit(1)

		2. trows keyword is use only for handling checked exception ONLY
		                          caller of the method will be responsibility for handling the exception

		Throw: use for manually throwing exception
		       syntax:
		               throw exceptionObject
